## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.


I am transforming the base R Markdown file into one for this assignment. Below I am reading in the mtcars dataset. And gaining a summary of it, should this be a more official program I would describe what I notice about the data and how to create a plot with it.

```{r cars}
library(ggplot2)
workdata<-mtcars
summary(mtcars)

```

## Creating My Own Code Chunk
Below is a code chunk I created myself in order to familairize myself with the process of doing so. I also create a simple graph output.  
```{r graphmaker}
ggplot(data = workdata, aes(x= mpg, y=disp))+
  geom_point()


```

## Hiding Code
In the following code chunk I will use *echo = FALSE* to hide the code of the plot while increasing the complexity of the graph. This allows me to create a markdown file with more robust visualizations that is not cluttered with lines of excess code.  

```{r robustgraph, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = workdata, aes(x= mpg, y=disp, size = 2, color = hp))+
  geom_point()+ guides(size = FALSE, color = guide_legend(title = "HP"))+
  ggtitle("Dispersal Over Miles Per Gallon") +theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"))

```
